# Idempotency

Some endpoints support idempotency to prevent duplicate operations during retries.

- Include an `Idempotency-Key` header with a unique UUID
- Retries with the same key return the original response for 24 hours
- Use UUIDs for new requests, reuse the same UUID when retrying failed requests
