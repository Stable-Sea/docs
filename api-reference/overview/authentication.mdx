## API Key Authentication

Stable Sea uses API keys to authenticate your requests. You can generate them from the **Terminal**.

<Warning>
  API keys are shown only once at the time of creation. Be sure to copy and
  store them securely â€” they cannot be retrieved from the dashboard after
  creation.
</Warning>

All API requests must include an `Authorization` header with: `Bearer <api-key>`

### Request Example

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api-sandbox.stablesea.xyz/v1/organizations" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## API Key Management

### Key Types

- **Sandbox Keys**: 64-character hexadecimal strings for development and testing
- **Production Keys**: 64-character hexadecimal strings for live transactions

API keys are 64-character lowercase hexadecimal strings (e.g., `a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef123456`)

### Security Best Practices

<Warning>
  Never commit API keys to version control or include them in client-side code.
  Always use environment variables or secure secret management systems.
</Warning>

- **Environment Variables**: Store keys in environment variables, never in code
- **Key Rotation**: Rotate keys every 90 days for enhanced security
- **Scope Limitation**: Use separate keys for different services/environments
- **Access Monitoring**: Monitor API key usage through dashboard analytics

<Tip>
  For production environments, consider using a secrets management service like
  AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or Azure Key Vault to automatically
  rotate keys.
</Tip>

### Key Permissions

| Permission Level | Description                     | Recommended Use           |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Read-Only**    | View resources, cannot modify   | Reporting, monitoring     |
| **Standard**     | Create/read/update operations   | Most integrations         |
| **Admin**        | Full access including deletions | Administrative operations |

## Security Features

### Audit Logging

All API requests are logged with:

- Request timestamp and duration
- Source IP address and user agent
- API key used (masked for security)
- Request and response status codes

Access audit logs through the Terminal dashboard or export via API.
