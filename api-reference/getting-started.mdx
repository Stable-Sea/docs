# Overview

The Stable Sea Terminal API provides programmatic access to terminal operations, enabling you to integrate shipping and logistics services directly into your applications.

# Authentication

Stable Sea uses API keys to authenticate your requests. You can generate them from the **Terminal**.

<Warning>
  API keys are shown only once at the time of creation. Be sure to copy and
  store them securely â€” they cannot be retrieved from the dashboard after
  creation.
</Warning>

All API requests must include an `Authorization` header with: `Bearer <api-key>`

# Making Requests

## Base URL

```
https://api.stablesea.com/terminal/v1
```

## Request Format

- All requests must be made over HTTPS TLS v1.2+
- Request bodies must be valid JSON with `Content-Type: application/json`
- All response bodies are returned as JSON

## HTTP Methods

- `GET` - Retrieve data (query parameters for filtering/pagination)
- `POST` - Create new resources
- `PATCH` - Update existing resources
- `DELETE` - Remove resources

# Error Handling

The API returns standard HTTP status codes:

- **2xx** - Success
- **4xx** - Client errors (invalid request, authentication, etc.)
- **5xx** - Server errors

## Error Response Format

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "string",
    "message": "string",
    "details": {}
  }
}
```

<Tip>
  `400` errors are typically developer errors that can be fixed by updating your
  request. `422` errors contain user-friendly messages that can be shown to end
  users.
</Tip>

# Idempotency

Some endpoints support idempotency to prevent duplicate operations during retries.

- Include an `Idempotency-Key` header with a unique UUID
- Retries with the same key return the original response for 24 hours
- Use UUIDs for new requests, reuse the same UUID when retrying failed requests
