A customer represents the customer _of an organization_. A customer must be created by the respective organization prior to leveraging Stable Sea's APIs to facilitate payouts or other services on behalf of that customers.

The customer will undergo KYX procedures prior to being approved by Stable Sea.

  created when the organization is successfully onboarded. This customer can be
  used to submit RFQs on behalf of the organization itself.
